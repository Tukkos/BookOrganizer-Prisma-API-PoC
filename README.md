# BookOrganizer-Typescript-API-PoC

This project is an PoC(Proof of Concept) with me learning to make an Postgres API with Typescript. This API is a Book Organizer that saves books with its status and number of pages, show books that are saved, delete books and update its status. The API have an option to show how many books and total pages that user have read.
